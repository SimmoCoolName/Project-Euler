# Problem 2
# Question: "Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# Code
sequence = [0,1]
total = 0

while sequence[-1]+sequence[-2] < 4000000:
	sequence.append(sequence[-1]+sequence[-2])
	if sequence[-1] % 2 == 0:
		total += sequence[-1]
	else:
		continue

print("total =",total)
